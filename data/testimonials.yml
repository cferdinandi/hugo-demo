I think having fewer restraints in solving the task made me focus more on the specific topic for that week and how I would apply it to the given project. Combining this with the Thursday office hour and then having your approach shared on Friday made for a well-rounded overview of the material.<br><br>Thanks for an awesome course, Chris! This truly was the best JS learning experience I‚Äôve had&mdash;things really clicked for me during the academy and I feel much more comfortable using JavaScript and approaching problems with JS-specific solutions at the ready!"

It was exactly what I was after.<br><br>I really benefited from and liked both the office hours (including code reviews) and the interaction with Chris and students on Slack (a big thing many other course do not have). It was also nice to see how other students approached the same problem. With having other students and you over a set period really helped encourage me to complete projects.<br><br>I never felt any imposter syndrome. We could ask any question and Chris was happy to help."
