<h1 class="text-xlarge text-normal">Some big heading for the homepage.</h1>

The regular heading will not show up.

## Some useful shortcodes

- `email` - [Encode your email](https://gomakethings.com/why-i-publish-my-email-address-on-the-web-and-how-i-prevent-spam/#but-what-about-spam) and add it here, then you can easily drop it throughout your site to keep it safe from spammers.
- `%md%` - Converts any content within it to markdown. Useful when nesting content inside elements, which would normally prevent it from being rendered as markdown.
- `year` - Prints the current year in `YYYY` format.
- `search-form` - Renders a search form on the page.

## What's included

- Styles for articles and basic pages
- An improved RSS feed over what Hugo does out of the box
- JS-based search for your articles
- Inlined CSS and JS for faster page loads
